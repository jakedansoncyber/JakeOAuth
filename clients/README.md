This folder contains the registered clients. This is for section 2 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.

Since the spec doesn't determine how this should be done, this will be done by a file containing json of all of the
registered clients to make this easy since we don't care about learning how registration is done...rather the OAuth2 spec
itself.
